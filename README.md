## UX

The aim of my site design was to be as simple, clear and concise as possible.

The Home and Pricing page have the same layout consisting of a section which takes up the whole width of the screen followed by three columns.

The pricing page utilises different opacity percentages in each column to represent different pricing tiers. This is discussed in more detail in the Colour Scheme section below.

The Join Us page has been kept very simple consiting of a form and an inspirational video only. The reason for the simplicity of this page is to ensure the user solely focuses on completing and submitting the form.

The website is designed to react responsively when the screen size decreases to medium and below.

When the screen size decreases beyond the medium breakpoint, the three columns which are usually adjacent to each other on a large screen will stack on top of each other. The contents of the footer also stack on top of each other to ensure the important information within the footer remains visible.

### Colour Scheme

The body has a background colour of _Davys Grey_ to convey an industrial theme. The text colour is _Cultured_ to allow the text to stand out against the darker background.

The navbar and footer have a _Black_ background with _Mikado Yellow_ text. This allows the navbar and footer to stand out against the body and the _Mikado Yellow_ text within the _Black_ navbar allows key information and icons to stand out across all pages. Any links within the body text e.g. 'Join Us' are also highlighted in _Mikado Yellow_ to maximise visibility.

The banner on the home page is _Mikado Yellow_ with 50% opacity applied to create a gold effect to convey a premium service. The text on the banner states the gym's motto and the colour used is _Cultured_. A text-shadow is applied whenever _Cultured_ is used on the light _Mikado Yellow_ background to maximise visibility and increase contrast ratio.

A _Mikado Yellow_ background with _Cultured_ text and text-shadowing is used on the Pricing page. The most premium membership tier has _Mikado Yellow_ background with 75% opacity, the middle tier has 50% opacity and the lowest tier has 25% opacity. This is used to convey that membership benefits decrease in line with the monthly payment.

The form on the Join Us page also has a _Mikado Yellow_ background with an opacity of 25%.

The colour scheme below was generated using [coolors](https://coolors.co/).

### Typography

The font selected for the website was _Arvo_ which was imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo).

This font was selected as it was easy to read and looked striking when capitalised.

All icons were sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

## Features 

### Existing Features

__Favicon__

This image features on the browser tab for all pages.

![Favicon](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-favicon.png)

__Navigation Bar__

This features on all pages and includes links to the gym's branding, Home page, Pricing page and Join Us page. The navigation bar is fully responsive and  is the same on each page to facilitate easy navigation.

The navigation bar will allow users to navigate the site on all devices without having to use the 'back' button. 

![Nav Bar](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-navbar.jpg)

__Home/Landing Page__

The home/landing page contains a photograph of a person grabbing a barbell ready to lift it with the SJ Fitness motto of 'Better Starts Today' on a banner above. This motto is present to convey that the aim of the gym is to improve their fitness and engcourages the user to start their journey as soon as possible. 

![Landing Page](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-landing-page.jpg)

__The 'SJ Fitness Difference' Section__

This section highlights the gym's features to clients and/or prospective clients. The aim of this section is to entice new clients to the gym by showcasing its premium features in a clean and concise way.

![The SJ Fitness Difference Section](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-difference-section.jpg)

__The 'How Can We Help You?' Section__

This section mentions numerous goals that clients may have in order to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. It leads on from the 'SJ Fitness Difference' section to highlight to clients and prospective clients that this is a gym for all abilities and all goals as opposed to only focussing on one type of training.

![How Can We Help You? Section](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-how-can-we-help-you-section.jpg)

__The 'Find Us!' Section__

This section is a Google Maps snapshot to assist clients in finding the gym.

![Find Us Section](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-find-us-section.jpg)

__The Footer__ 

The footer section includes links to social media sites (facebook, twitter, instagram), and an email address to help potential clients get in contact with SJ Fitness. The social media links open to a new tab for easier navigation.

The footer is valuable for the gym business as it allows prospective clients to follow them on social media and to get in touch about new memberships. It is also valuable for the user as it directs them to the social media sites and gives them an email point of contact to ask any questions prior to signing up via the 'Join Us' page.

![Footer](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-footer.jpg)

__The Pricing Page__

The pricing page has a brief explanation at the top of the page below the navigation bar which also contains a hyperlink to the Join Us page so that the user can immediately navigate to sign up.

![Pricing Intro](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-pricing-intro.jpg)

The pricing page is then split into three columns which represents the different membership tiers and their respecting monthly cost. The information on different tiers is concisely summarised via the use of bullet points so that the user is not overloaded with too much information regarding the membership types.

The membership tiers and bullet points are positioned in such a way that it is clear to see what is omitted as the pricing tier decreases which makes comparison of membership tiers easier for the user. This is also a strategy to increase the gym's revenue by convincing prospective clients to sign up for the top tier as they can see that the top tier does provide more for their money when comparing membership options.

![Pricing Tiers](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-pricing-tiers.jpg)

__The Join Us Page__

This page will allow the user to join SJ Fitness. The user will be able select their desired membership type whilst also being asked to provide their full name and email address.

![Join Us Form](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-join-us-form.jpg)

Below the Join Us form, there is a looped video of a group of people high fiving each other which is used to convey the fact that the client is joining a supportive community by joining SJ Fitness.

![Join Us Video](documentation/testing/sj-fitness-join-us-video.jpg)

### Features Left to Implement

A future feature to implement would be the embedding of fitness related videos which loop on all pages as opposed to the Join Us page only, a gallery to showcase people enjoying the experience of exercising at SJ Fitness and a timetable of classes so clients can plan their week of exercise.
