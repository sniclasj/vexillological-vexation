# Testing

## Test Driven Development with JEST

A test driven development approach was taken in order to develop the game. This was done by utilising the JEST testing suite.
Tests were built and validated prior to building core game functionality.

During the course of developing the game, limitations with the JEST test suite were encountered.
This is likely related to the way I have written my code and this will therefore be a consideration for future projects.
In order to evaluate the limitations, an explanation of how the code functions is required. This is detailed in the following section.

### Code Functionality Explanation

- In vex-vex.html, the buttons where the clickable flag images are displayed have respective IDs "option1" and "option2" as well as the class of "flag".

```html
    <!-- Section for the two clickable buttons displaying respective flag images -->
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6 text-center">
                <button id="option1" class="flag" aria-label="flag option 1"></button>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 text-center">
                <button id="option2" class="flag" aria-label="flag option 2"></button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
```

- In vex-vex.js, two functions (optionGen and changeIds) run once the DOM content of vex-vex.html has loaded.

```javascript
// Awaits for the content of the page to be loaded before running optionGen and changeIds functions which are integral to displaying the flag options for the player to guess.
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    optionGen();
    changeIds();
});
```

- optionGen randomly selects two different flag IDs from game.database.flags and changeIds replaces the IDs of the clickable button elements with the flag IDs generated by optionGen as well as updating the background image of the flag class to match the flag ID image.

```javascript
// Function to randomly generate values for game.option1 and 
// game.option2 from the game.database.flags array.
function optionGen() {
    game.questionnum++;
    document.getElementById("question-num").innerHTML = `Question Number: ` + (game.questionnum);
    game.option1 = (game.database.flags[Math.floor(Math.random() * game.database.flags.length)]);

    //Filters game.option1 value out of game.database.flags array
    //and selects game.option2 value from filtered array. This
    //ensures that game.option1 != game.option2.
    //Credit: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_filter.asp
    //Credit: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5767325/how-can-i-remove-a-specific-item-from-an-array
    let value = game.option1;
    let arr = game.database.flags;
    let databaseFilt = arr.filter(function (item) {
        return item !== value;
    });
    //Generates game.option2 value from the filtered dabase which does
    //not contain the generated game.option1 value.
    game.option2 = (databaseFilt[Math.floor(Math.random() * databaseFilt.length)]);
    //Generates question value which is either game.option1 or game.option2.
    game.question = [game.option1, game.option2][Math.round(Math.random())];
}

// Replaces html elements with ids option1 and option2 with the randomly generated flag image background ids game.option1 and game.option2.
function changeIds() {
    // Credit: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_id.asp

    let flag1 = document.getElementById("option1");
    let flag2 = document.getElementById("option2");
    flag1.style.background = `url(assets/images/${game.option1}-flag.png) center no-repeat`;
    flag2.style.background = `url(assets/images/${game.option2}-flag.png) center no-repeat`;
    flag1.id = game.option1;
    flag2.id = game.option2;
    // Identifies index of country name linked to random flag id used for game.question and publishes it into the innerHTML text of html element with id "question".
    // Credit: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_node_textcontent_innerhtml_innertext
    let indexQ = game.database.flags.indexOf(game.question);
    document.getElementById("question").innerHTML = `Which flag belongs to...` + (game.database.countries[indexQ]) + `?`;
}
```

- Once the functions optionGen and changeIds have run, the clickable buttons in vex-vex.html will no longer have the IDs "option1" and "option2" but they will have the values of game.option1 and game.option2 respectively. The values of game.option1 and game.option2 will correspond to a three letter country code e.g. 'wal' for Wales. This three letter country code matches the image for that respective flag in the images folder e.g. wal-flag which applies a background of the Welsh flag to the button.

![Welsh Flag ID Update](documentation/testing/vex-vex-id-update-wal-updated.png)

![Welsh Flag Image File](documentation/testing/vex-vex-wal-flag-image.png)

- The next step is for the player to attempt to guess the correct flag by clicking on one of the buttons.
- When this occurs, the checkAnswer function runs. The checkAnswer function's role is to check if the player's guess is correct or incorrect, however, additional functions run as part of the checkAnswer function.
- One of these functions is revertIds which runs before optionGen and changeIds run again within the checkAnswer function.

```javascript
// Changes the flag image background ids of html elements with ids game.option1 and game.option2 back to option1 and option2 respectively.
function revertIds() {
    let opt1 = document.getElementById(game.option1);
    let opt2 = document.getElementById(game.option2);
    opt1.style.background = `url(assets/images/all-flags.gif) center no-repeat`;
    opt2.style.background = `url(assets/images/all-flags.gif) center no-repeat`;
    opt1.id = "option1";
    opt2.id = "option2";
}
```

```javascript
function checkAnswer() {
    // Defines indexQ as the value of the index of flag id pushed into game.question.
    let indexQ = game.database.flags.indexOf(game.question);
    // If game.playerguess id == game.question id:
    if (game.playerguess == game.question) {
        // id of game.question is pushed into game.usedflags array.
        game.usedflags.push(game.question);
        // Flag id and country id are spliced from the overall game.database so that they cannot appear in the game again.
        // Splice code credit: https://love2dev.com/blog/javascript-remove-from-array/#remove-from-array-splice
        game.database.flags.splice(indexQ, 1);
        game.database.countries.splice(indexQ, 1);
        // game.correctscore increments by 1 and the value of the html element with id "correct" is updated to the new value.
        game.correctscore++;
        document.getElementById("correct").innerHTML = game.correctscore;
        // If game.playerguess == the id "option1"or "option2", this ensures the score remains as zero.
        // This is to prevent accidental score incrementation in the short period of time where placeholder images are in place instead of flag images.
        // The ids of the placeholder images are "option1" and "option2" respectively so if these are clicked, the code below ensures the scores do not accidentally increment.
    } else if (game.playerguess == "option1") {
        game.correctscore = 0;
        game.incorrectscore = 0;
    } else if (game.playerguess == "option2") {
        game.correctscore = 0;
        game.incorrectscore = 0;
        // If game.playerguess != game.question:
        // game.incorrectscore increments by 1 and the value of the html element with id "incorrect" is updated to the new value.
    } else if (game.playerguess != game.question) {
        game.incorrectscore++;
        document.getElementById("incorrect").innerHTML = game.incorrectscore;
    }
    // Calls previously defined functions within the checkAnswer function.
    resetGuess();
    revertIds();
    optionGen();
    changeIds();
    endGame();
}
```

- revertIds changes the IDs of the clickable buttons from the values of game.option1 and game.option2 back to their original IDs of "option1" and "option2" e.g. the ID of one of the buttons would be updated from "wal" back to "option1".
- This allows changeIds to 'find' the button elements and update their respective IDs to new game.option1 and game.option2 values generated by optionGen for the next question in the game.
- This means that an example flow of the button elements' IDs would be "option1" -> "wal" -> "option1" -> "nzl". This would represent question 1 displaying the Welsh flag and question 2 displaying a New Zealand flag.
- The transition from an ID of "wal" -> "option1" -> "nzl" is seamless and it looks like an instant transition from "wal" to "nzl" however the method of achieving this has caused issues when running the JEST test suite.

### Test Limitations Discussion

Based on the above description of code functionality, I was unable to test if the functions optionGen and changeIDs worked in the desired way solely within the test suite. This is because the test was never able to find HTML elements with the IDs of "option1" or "option2".
The reason for this is that by the time the page had loaded, the below code had executed meaning that the IDs had already changed to values such as 'wal' and 'nzl'.

```javascript
// Awaits for the content of the page to be loaded before running optionGen and changeIds functions which are integral to displaying the flag options for the player to guess.
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    optionGen();
    changeIds();
});
```

This meant that the tests always failed despite the game functioning exactly as expected when looking at information in the console.

The next issue I encountered was that the test suite would not run at all unless I commented out the below code.

![Code Needing Commenting Out For Test Suite To Work](documentation/testing/vex-vex-code-needing-commenting-out-for-test-functionality.png)

When attempting to run the code without commenting this code out, the below was returned.

![Test Suite Error](documentation/testing/vex-vex-test-error-message.png)

When I commented this code out before running the tests, the following results and coverage reports were achieved.

![Code Commented Out](documentation/testing/vex-vex-code-commented-out-for-test-functionality.png)

![Tests Passing](documentation/testing/vex-vex-tests-passed.png)

![Test Coverage Report](documentation/testing/vex-vex-jest-coverage.png)
Note: To obtain a coverage report, the following must be enterted into the console: _npm test -- --coverage_.

Unfortunately, this code is essential to the functionality of the game so it cannot be removed from the vex-vex.js file permanently.

Again, I believe the reason for this test suite failure is due to the fact that elements with IDs of "option1" and "option2" only exist transiently in my code which means that the tests cannot 'find' these IDs which leads to test failures.

Despite the afforementioned test issues, the game functions exactly as desired and this is verified by observing the console whilst playing the game.
In future projects, I will keep these learnings in mind and this will help me devlop my code writing skills to ensure that these issues do not arise again.

### Semantic HTML Discussion

I have intentionally decided not to use sections in my HTML files. The reason for this is that when I was utilising sections, the HTML validators referenced above were issuing warning regarding the lack of headings in my sections. Although I am aware that I should be utilising sections as opposed to divs in order to be to semantically correct, the presence of section headings would detract from the desired aesthetic of my game therefore I have opted to maintain the use of divs and explain my reasoning here.

### CSS

No errors or warnings were found on any page when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsniclasj.github.io%2Fvexillological-vexation%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#warnings) as shown in the screenshot below.

The _undefined variable_ of _module_ shown in the JS Hint screenshot is required to export the objects and functions to the Jest testing file. The following code prevents this causing an error in the console. This JS Hint 'warning' can be ignored in this context.

```javascript
if (typeof module !== "undefined") module.exports = {
    game,
    optionGen,
    changeIds,
    revertIds,
    playerGuess,
    resetGuess,

The only issue highlighted in the Lighthouse testing is the use of the .gif format on the animated content on the Results Summary Page. The report has suggested utilising a video format such as .mp4 instead, however, I could only find the animated content I wanted to use in .gif format.
In future, I will filter my search for animated content to ensure that the .gif format is omitted.
